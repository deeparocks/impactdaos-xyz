This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# The Impact DAOs Book

## Contributors Needed

Contributors needed to visualize everything from the book. Visualizing information makes it easy for newcomers to grasp new concepts. The book, [The Definitive Guide to Impact DAOs](https://impactdaos.xyz/), results from intensive research of 12 Impact DAOs with 1:1 interviews with 30 Impact DAO builders. The information presented in this book is the only source of truth on Impact DAOs, a new internet-native way of organizing for social good. The book itself was produced by a DAO, Impact DAO Media. We'd now like to tap into the expertise of our broader community to enhance this book further.


## Let's build from here

We've identified some key concepts for visual illustrations. Contributors whose pull requests get merged will be awarded SBTs ([Otter badges](https://otterspace.xyz/)) and an invitation to participate in the governance of [Impact DAO Media.](https://twitter.com/impactdaos)

## Dev Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
