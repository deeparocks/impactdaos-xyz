## Five Types of Impact DAOs

> :warning: Are you an Impact DAO let us know [fill out this 1-minute form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy5kyXh_HddBkWmXJt3XhQ454f5lCCGPc8LHeHyodmhVa7xg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

We reviewed the mission statement of over 70 Impact DAOs, and they fall into these 5 categories. Impact DAOs are [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://impactdaos.xyz/posts/2-what-is-a-dao) whose core purpose is to do good for people and the planet.

The top 5 emerging Impact DAO categories and what they stand for:

### **🚀 Enabler**

These DAOs enable impact through training, funding, and other infrastructure support. They are meta DAOs and do not directly participate in impact delivery. Examples of enabler DAOs include [Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin) (funding), [LexDAO](https://twitter.com/lex_DAO) (legal), and [Impact DAO Media](https://twitter.com/impactdaos) (research).

Enablers can be further segmented based on the service they provide such as funding, media, education, or incubator DAOs.

### **🌱Climate**

DAOs engaged in climate change mitigation fall under this category. The current climate DAO’s focus areas include agriculture, carbon credits, land regeneration, and natural assets tokenization. [Klima DAO](https://twitter.com/KlimaDAO) (carbon credits), [Kokonut DAO](https://twitter.com/KokonutNetwork) (agriculture), [Basin DAO](https://twitter.com/basinDAO) (land restoration), and [United Species DAO](https://twitter.com/United_Species) (community resilience) are examples of climate DAOs.

### **❤️ Social Impact**

DAOs whose mission is to improve the lives of people fall into this category. Social Impact DAOs are currently operating in the space of social and financial inclusion, hyper-local mutual aid, and humanitarian aid. Examples include [Human DAO](https://twitter.com/humanDAO) (financial inclusion), [Impact Market](https://twitter.com/impactMarket_) (UBI), [Ukraine DAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO) (disaster management), and [Pact DAO](https://twitter.com/pactDAO) (hyper-local city based mutual aid).

### **🧬 DeSci**

DAOs in the area of scientific research, funding, and innovation. For instance, [Vita DAO](https://twitter.com/vita_dao) (longevity), [Valley DAO](https://twitter.com/valley_dao) (synthetic biology), [FrontierDAO](https://twitter.com/FrontierDAO) (fusion and Ag tech). Based on the nature of their core activities, DeSci DAOs can be further categorized into research publishing, funding, or scientific innovation incubators.

### **🌐 Network State DAOs**

They are the newly emerging category of Impact DAOs formed around network states, a concept detailed by Balaji Srinivasan in his book, [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/). Many DAOs are experimenting in this space, as the first step towards a network state is a highly aligned online community. Some network state DAOs have even acquired real-world assets, such as [City DAO](https://twitter.com/CityDAO), [Cabin DAO](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins), and [Kift DAO](https://twitter.com/kiftlife).

> A network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states. - [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/), Balaji Srinivasan
