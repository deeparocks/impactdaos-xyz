# Closing Notes

Peaking at the future of doing good is exciting! From voluntary carbon credits to UBI, we’ve covered the present of mature ImpactDAOs. This is a part of a larger conversation around what the future will look like and, specifically, what the future of work will be. The future of work for the individual and collective is distributed, coordinated, and self-sovereign individuals solving the brokenness of the world together. The way to do this is through ImpactDAOs.

In a combination of asynchronous and synchronous work, self-sovereign individuals - bound by their voluntary commitments to various DAOs - will do well by doing good and have fun doing it. Bringing one’s whole self to work will become the norm; everyone will be at once diplomat and entrepreneur. Juggling various commitments and alignments to various DAOs will become normal.

With the widespread access of the Internet and smartphone adoption, cooperative crypto-native collectives will flourish as traditional hierarchical organizations decline in both attractiveness to potential talent and in their effectiveness to achieve their respective goals/missions. They’ll become less attractive to talent due to the lack of actual ownership over the value they - as individuals - create, as well as their lack of mission to do good by their communities and environment. The effectiveness of traditional organizations to achieve their respective goals will decrease because of the lack of top notch talent working with them. There will be a brain drain from geographical-centric workplaces to more distributed, cooperative, crypto-native ImpactDAOs, even if they focus on hyper-local issues, because of the way that ownership is distributed.

Specifically, ImpactDAOs will spread virally, create better commons, increase the transparency of their impact by tying it to on-chain activity, and contribute significantly to a rise in more cooperative operations structures enabled by web3 tech. It is already happening to spread UBI projects like GoodDollar worldwide; Ukraine DAO raised $7m purely online through crypto for the war effort. Better commons and mechanisms for scaling them are being created by Commons Stack through their token engineering efforts and tools to model collective public goods at scale.

Traditional organizations will need to do more than just accept cryptocurrency to survive the coming storm. They will need to become organizations that embrace an agile methodology and coordinate distributed contributors in a way that makes sense for their specific impact. In other words, many traditional organizations will opt to transition to an ImpactDAO to survive and/or adapt and thrive with new web3 coordination tools.

ImpactDAOs are using different methods of tracking their impact on-chain and displaying that data transparently on-chain. Traditional organizations will also need to become more transparent and tamper-resistant following Charity:Water’s and Watsi’s footsteps. KlimaDAO is already tying voluntary carbon credits to transparent, immutable blockchain. A step ahead, many ImpactDAOs multisig wallets are available to audit on-chain as well.

It’s clear that this is just the beginning. We’ve covered 12 mature ImpactDAOs primed to make long-standing differences in a variety of ways. There are a variety of ways to get involved and, with your luck, we’re early. However, ImpactDAOs are here to stay. For more ways to get involved with the 12 mature ImpactDAOs we’ve researched, please feel free to reach out to them through their respective Discords, website, and Twitters. Look forward to seeing you in the mix!
